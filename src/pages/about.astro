    <div class="glass surface-alt space-y-6 rounded-3xl p-8 text-sm leading-relaxed text-white/70">
      <p>We began by redesigning the ledger so every transaction feeds a single, trusted source of truth for multi-entity operations.</p>
      <p>Next we focused on orchestration backed by data. Dynamic retries, granular routing, and no-code risk policies help teams protect revenue without extra headcount.</p>
      <p>Today our customers process billions across 30+ countries, supported by a distributed team with deep payments, risk, and infrastructure experience.</p>
